# Elephant-Image-Classification
## Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of elephants into two categories: African elephants and Asian elephants. The model is trained to accurately identify the species of elephants based on their distinctive features.

## Features
Binary Classification: Differentiates between African and Asian elephants.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Utilizes deep learning techniques for image classification.
Image Analysis: Processes and analyzes images to identify elephant species.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of labeled images of African and Asian elephants. You can download the dataset from the following link:
